Welcome to my Sports Science Portfolio!


I am Jerrel Bushel, currently a sports science intern at New York City FC First team.

This portfolio is a collection of sports science and biomechanics projects that I have worked on in my sports science career to date.
Below is a short description of each element of this portfolio.

I am open and welcome to constructive feedback as I am willing to learn and grow in this field!
If you'd like to connect or have any questions, comments, or concerns please feel free to reach out at any of my contacts below.

Enjoy!


Dashboards: This is a VALD monitoring dashboard for Track and Field athletes at Duke University. This dashboard includes a quick snapshot of the team countermovement jump (CMJ) metrics of interest as well as individual longitudinal monitoring. I also calculated a Dynamic Strngth Index (DSI) score, a ratio that measures the athletes' dynamic CMJ power compared to their raw strength -- peak force during isometric mid thigh pull (IMTP).


OpenBiomechanics Project: The OpenBiomechanics Project is open source data provided by Driveline Baseball. I utilized the baseball_pitching point-of-interest csv provided by Driveline to conduct descriptive and exploratory analysis for my personal development of coding and statistical analysis. 


Pitcher Biomechanical Analysis: The pitcher biomechanical analysis was a project comparing a pitcher's kinematics to that of 50 fastest pitchers in the MLB. The pitcher's kinematic sequence of the pelvis, trunk, shoulder, elbow, and hand was plotted and analyzed to determine shortcomings and changes between two innings.


Jerrel's Master Thesis 2024: This file is the final submission of my masters thesis project. This project explored changes in drop jump kinetics and kinematics as a result of an external cue-focused intervention training program. Kinetic data was collected using inbedded Bertec forceplates, kinematic data collected using Vicon 3D motion capture system and software, data processing with Visual3d, and data analysis with SPSS.
